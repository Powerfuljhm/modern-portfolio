        <p>Full Stack JavaScript Developer with an interest in a variety of content and ideas. 
          I am a self taught programmer who learned HTML in high school and went back to teach
          myself responsive web design and JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms to work
          with JavaScript frameworks. I attended college for a career as a Firefighter/Paramedic,
          however, I discovered while working as an Emergency Medical Technician that the cultural 
          fit wasn't for me; furthermore, I have decided to put a purpose to my passion and break into
          tech to work as a software engineer and build products and services that make a
          significant impact on the world.I have learned React to build complex UI interfaces and
          I enjoy working in teams in person to communicate and share ideas and learn from
          fellow developers to expand my knowledge with an openness to learn new technologies.
